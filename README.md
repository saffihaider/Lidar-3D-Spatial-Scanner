# Lidar-3D-Spatial-Scanner

This project is a half-duplex 3D spatial mapping device based on a Cortex-M4 microcontroller and a time-of-flight sensor. It is programmed in embedded C and utilizes a Python script with the Open3D library to visualize scans. To communicate with my PC, it uses the UART communication protocol. The system is capable of accurately scanning spaces up to 4 meters wide with high accuracy using LIDAR distance measurements. The software is customizable to allow the user to modify scan accuracy as a tradeoff with scanning time.
